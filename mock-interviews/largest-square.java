    Problem:
    Given an array <rectangles> that contains the length and
    width of n rectangles such that rectangle[n] = [length,width].
    Find the largest square that can be made and return the number of times
    the square of length = maxLen and width = maxWidth can be created.

    Possible input:
    - 2d array of integers
    - empty array
    - array of an infinite number of elements

    Possible output:
    - integer representing the number of times a square was created with the dimensions
    of maxLen by maxWidth

    Assumptions:
    - the dimensions of each rectangle will always be a pair of positive integers

    Soulution:
    - TODO

    Analysis:
    Time complexity - O ()
    Space complexity - O ()
