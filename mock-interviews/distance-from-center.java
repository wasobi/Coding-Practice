    Problem:
    Given an array <rectangles> that contains the length and
    width of n rectangles such that rectangle[n] = [length,width].
    Find the largest square that can be made and return the number of times
    the square of length = maxLen and width = maxWidth can be created.

    Possible input:
    - 2d array of integers
    - empty array
    - array of an infinite number of elements

    Possible output:
    - array of n = queries.length elements
    - each index in the output array should represent how many points from the points array were located withing the circle

    Assumptions:
    - integers that represent coordinates on a plane can be positive or negative
    - number of points has no correlation with the number of circles

    Soulution:
    - TODO

    Analysis:
    Time complexity - O ()
    Space complexity - O ()
